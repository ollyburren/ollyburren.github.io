I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student within the [Diabetes and Inflammation (DIL) Laboratory](https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Todd_(biologist)">John Todd</a> with statistical and computational co-supervision from <a href="http://chr1swallace.github.io/">Chris Wallace</a> who is a Wellcome Trust senior research fellow in the Department of Medicine and a Programme leader at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) and [Leonardo Bottolo](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=nNBd7i0AAAAJ&hl=en), a reader in statistics for biomedicine in the Department of Medical Genetics. Concurrently I am Head of Genome Informatics at the DIL, and am lucky to manage a team of three very talented Bioinformaticians, who are responsible for [ImmunoBase](http://www.immunobase.org) and [T1DBase](http://www.t1dbase.org), two widely used and cited human autoimmune genetic databases. 

## Current Research

Work I have carried out [previously](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170024), attempted to tag genes with disease based on proximity, however this is an oversimplification. At the Babraham Institute [Peter Fraser's](http://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/nuclear-dynamics/peter-fraser) group has been pioneering a technique called 'promoter capture Hi-C' that gives us information about which regions of DNA bend and touch each other, even though they might be distant on a linear DNA molecule. With many others we have been working on methods to leverage these interactions in 17 primary human cell types with other genomic datasets to get a better understanding of immune function in humans. I have the task to intergrate GWAS summary statistics with these data to answer the following questions:-

  * Are GWAS signals for traits enriched within interactions, and if so is this tissue specific ?
  * How can we use this information to prioritise genes and GWAS signals for followup study ?
