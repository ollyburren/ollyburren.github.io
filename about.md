I currently work as Director of Genome Informatics within [Ken Smith's](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/about-the-department/head-of-department/) group. Until recently I was a PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) in [Chris Wallace's Group](http://chr1swallace.github.io/) and I am currently waiting for my thesis to be examined. I used to be  Head of Genome Informatics at the [DIL](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/todd-group), and was lucky to manage a team of three bioinformaticians, who were responsible for [ImmunoBase](http://www.immunobase.org) and T1DBase, two widely used and cited human autoimmune genetic databases. I currently maintain [CHiCP](https://www.chicp.org), a tool to visualise GWAS summary statistics in the context of tissue-specific chromatin looping events.
