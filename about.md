I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student within the [Wallace Group](http://chr1swallace.github.io/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). I have a part-time role in [Ken Smith's](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/about-the-department/head-of-department/) group as Director of Genome Informatics. I used to be  Head of Genome Informatics at the [DIL](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/todd-group), and was lucky to manage a team of three bioinformaticians, who were responsible for [ImmunoBase](http://www.immunobase.org) and T1DBase, two widely used and cited human autoimmune genetic databases. I currently maintain [CHiCP](https://www.chicp.org), a tool to visualised GWAS summary statistics in the context of chromatin looping.
