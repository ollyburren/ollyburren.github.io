###  Integrating ''P''romoter **C**apture **Hi-C** (PCHIC) with GWAS summary statistics to prioritise candidate disease genes and tissues 

We tend to  think of DNA as a linear sequence, however it a has complex and dynamic three dimensional structure that is important to function. In order to better understand it's role in the gene regulation and haematopoiesis [Peter Fraser's](http://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/nuclear-dynamics/peter-fraser) group has generated high resolution interaction maps detailing high confidence promoter interactions across 17 primary human cell types.  In collaboration with Chris Wallace I have developed [statistical methods](http://github.com/ollyburren/CHIGP) to use these maps to connect putative risk variants in 32 publicly available GWAS studies to causal genes and tissues. In order to facillate access to these datasets we have developed a novel tool - [CHiCP](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/04/08/bioinformatics.btw173.abstract)

### Understanding the genomics of CD4+ T Cell activation and their role in autoimmunity.

Working collaboratively with Chris Wallace, Tony Cutler, Arcadio Rubio Garcia, Linda Wicker and John Todd we are seeking to better understand CD4+ T cell activation in humans as previous research has highlighted a role for this process in autoimmune disease susceptibility. Using microarray timecourse analysis of 20 individuals we identified the optimal window to assess the genomic events that shape CD4+ T Cell activation in humans. We then carried out deep genomic phenotyping of pooled samples of matched CD4+ activated and nonactivated T cells at this time point. This included CHiP-Seq, total RNA-Seq and PCHi-C. We used this rich dataset to characterise the cellular events that characterise CD4+ T cell activation. Using cutting edge fine mapping techniques we have then begun linking causal variants in autoimmune disease to these activation events. 

### ImmunoBase

Working with Tim Carver, Ellen Schofield and Prem Acuthan, we have developed a database that brings together carefully curated content of the genetics of autoimmune susceptibility. This includes full summary statistics for a number of autoimmune disease GWAS and ImmunoChip studies. The software is freely available and we investgating cloud delivery techniques to enable easy deployment and development.
