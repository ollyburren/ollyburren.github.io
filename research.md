###  Integrating Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHIC) with GWAS summary statistics to prioritise candidate disease genes and tissues. 

We tend to  think of DNA as a linear sequence, however it a has complex and dynamic three dimensional structure that is important to function. In order to better understand it's role in gene regulation and haematopoeisis [Peter Fraser's](http://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/nuclear-dynamics/peter-fraser) group has generated high resolution interaction maps detailing high confidence promoter interactions across 17 primary human cell types.  In collaboration with Chris Wallace, I have developed [statistical methods](http://github.com/ollyburren/CHIGP) to use these maps to connect putative risk variants in 32 publicly available GWAS studies to causal genes and tissues. In order to facillate access to these datasets we have developed a novel tool - [CHiCP](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/04/08/bioinformatics.btw173.abstract).

### Understanding the genomics of CD4+ T Cell activation and their role in autoimmunity.

Previous autoimmune disease research has hilighted the importance of CD4+ T cell activation in disease pathology. Working collaboratively with Chris Wallace, Tony Cutler, Arcadio Rubio Garcia, Linda Wicker and John Todd I am seeking to better understand the genomics of this process in humans. Using microarray timecourse analysis of 20 individuals we identified the optimal window to assess the genomic events that shape the process of CD4+ T cell activation in humans. We then carried out deep genomic phenotyping of pooled samples of matched CD4+ activated and nonactivated T cells at this time point. This included CHiP-Seq, total RNA-Seq and PCHi-C. We used this rich dataset to characterise the cellular events that characterise CD4+ T cell activation. Using cutting edge fine mapping techniques we have then begun linking causal variants in autoimmune disease to these activation events. 

### ImmunoBase - A curated database for the genetics of autoimmune disease susceptibility.

Working with Tim Carver, Ellen Schofield and Prem Acuthan, we have developed a database that brings together carefully curated content of the genetics of autoimmune susceptibility. This includes full summary statistics for a number of autoimmune disease GWAS and ImmunoChip studies. The software is freely [available](https://github.com/D-I-L/pydgin) and we investgating cloud delivery techniques to enable easy deployment and development.
